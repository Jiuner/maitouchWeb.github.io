                <h4>m'AI Touch Wins Yunus Innovation Award for Technology, Showcasing Excellence in Contactless Technology.</h4>
                <br>
                <p>The m'AI Touch team stood out from over 200 participating teams in this year's Taiwan Yunus Innovation Award, earning third place in the social category, once again proving their excellence in the field of contactless technology. The Taiwan Yunus Innovation Award, supported by Terry Gou, founder of Hon Hai Group since 2019, is dedicated to promoting social innovation and the development of social enterprises, and has now become a significant platform leading the wave of social enterprise innovation in Taiwan.</p> 
                <p>Despite the severe challenges posed by the pandemic, m'AI Touch remained committed to innovation, striving to seamlessly integrate virus prevention technologies into everyday life. By combining multiple sensors with the dual assurance of AI algorithms, m'AI Touch successfully addressed many issues with non-contact elevator buttons on the market, allowing users to maintain their habitual operations while enjoying a more stable and accurate elevator experience.</p> 
                <p>Compared to traditional methods that require extensive manpower for cleaning, m'AI Touch's technology not only effectively prevents virus transmission but also significantly reduces resource waste, extends equipment lifespan, and enhances overall public health standards. This contactless device is compatible with all types of new and old elevators, requiring no replacement of the existing elevator panels, and is quick and easy to install.</p> 
                <p>We are deeply honored to receive high recognition from many experts, including former Premier Mao C. K. and Chairperson Tsai Hui-ling of the Yunus Foundation, during this competition. This is not only an affirmation of m'AI Touch's technical capabilities but also support for our mission to promote social enterprise innovation and enhance public health.</p> 
                <p>Looking ahead, m'AI Touch will continue to uphold the spirit of innovation, constantly exploring and developing more forward-looking technologies to create a safer and more convenient living environment for society. We firmly believe that through continuous innovation and effort, we will become a key player in the global contactless technology field, bringing more high-quality solutions to the market.</p>
