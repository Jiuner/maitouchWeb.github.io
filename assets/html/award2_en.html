                <h4>m'AI Touch Wins the 19th National Innovation Award, Gaining High Recognition for Technological Innovation.</h4>
                <br>
                <p>The m'AI Touch team stood out in this year's 19th National Innovation Award, earning the prestigious honor and being selected as one of the top ten highlights of the InnoZone Technology Special Exhibition, showcasing their excellence in technological innovation and immense potential for future development.</p> 
                <p>The National Innovation Award, established by the Taiwan Bio Industry Organization, is the most prestigious award in Taiwan's biomedical field, academic research institutions, and hospitals. Each year, it attracts numerous companies to participate, making the competition highly fierce. After a rigorous three-stage review process, winning teams are not only recognized for their technological innovations by the government and industry but also gain the opportunity to showcase Taiwan's research and innovation capabilities on the international stage.</p> 
                <p>m'AI Touch, through the dual assurance of heterogeneous sensors and AI algorithms, successfully solved the technical challenges of non-contact elevator buttons in the market. Our core technology focuses on seamlessly integrating virus prevention solutions into daily life, allowing users to enjoy highly stable and accurate elevator operations without changing their habitual operation methods. Compared to traditional methods that require extensive manpower for cleaning (such as disinfection films and alcohol sanitization), m'AI Touch's technology not only effectively prevents virus transmission but also significantly reduces resource waste and improves public hygiene standards. This AI-powered non-contact add-on device is suitable for all types of new and old elevators, without the need to modify existing panels. Installation time can be reduced to under three hours, greatly minimizing renovation time and cost. Even elevators with access control systems are not affected by the add-on device.</p> 
                <p>m'AI Touch's breakthrough achievements in the field of contactless technology won the judges' favor. This honor not only symbolizes our technological prowess but also marks a significant step in advancing biomedical innovation. Moving forward, we will continue to uphold the spirit of innovation, developing more forward-looking technologies to bring more solutions to the global biomedical industry and improve the quality of human life.</p>
