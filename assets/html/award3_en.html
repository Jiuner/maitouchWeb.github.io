                <h4>m'AI Touch Wins 2023 FutureTech Award, Earning Further Recognition for Technological Innovation.</h4>
                <br>
                <p>The m'AI Touch team stood out in this year's 2023 FutureTech Award, earning the prestigious honor jointly awarded by the National Science and Technology Council, Academia Sinica, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Our technology was recognized as one of the key benchmark technologies in the "AIoT Smart Applications" category, showcasing our exceptional achievements in technological innovation and application promotion.</p>
                <p>The FutureTech Award is specifically designed to recognize technologies or innovations that have made significant progress in the two core criteria of "scientific breakthroughs" and "industrial applicability." In 2023, the winning technologies, selected from over 500 submissions, demonstrated not only high innovation in technological development and commercial value but also immense potential for entering the international market.</p>
                <p>The core technology of m'AI Touch combines heterogeneous sensors with AI algorithms, providing dual assurance and successfully overcoming the technical challenges of non-contact elevator buttons in the market. Our technology seamlessly integrates into daily life, allowing users to enjoy a stable and accurate elevator experience without having to change their original operating habits.</p>
                <p>Compared to traditional disinfection methods, m'AI Touch's solution not only effectively prevents virus transmission but also significantly reduces resource waste and enhances public health. This AI-powered non-contact add-on device is suitable for all types of new and old elevators, with no need to replace the existing panels. Installation time is reduced to less than three hours, greatly cutting down renovation time and costs. Even elevators with access control systems will not be affected by the add-on device.</p>
                <p>m'AI Touch will continue to uphold the spirit of innovation, constantly exploring and developing more forward-looking technologies, providing more solutions to the global market, and further advancing the development of AIoT smart applications.</p>
