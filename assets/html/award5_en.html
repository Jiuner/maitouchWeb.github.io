                <p>The m'AI Touch team stood out in this year's Asia Golden Pin EE Creative Challenge, winning the Innovation Award and the Spotlight Award in the Campus Category, showcasing our exceptional performance and technical expertise in innovative smart application design.</p>
                <p>The EE Creative Challenge is jointly organized and promoted by the Digital Industry Agency of the Ministry of Digital Affairs, the Taipei City Department of Economic Development, the National Applied Research Laboratories, the Service Systems Technology Center of the Industrial Technology Research Institute, and the Industry Service Center of the Industrial Technology Research Institute. It aims to encourage innovative and diverse smart application designs, expand new innovative applications and value-added services, and promote the development of the overall industry value chain. Receiving these honors in this competition not only demonstrates m'AI Touch's capability in cutting-edge technology development but also highlights our vision of advancing smart living.</p>
                <p>The core technology of m'AI Touch combines heterogeneous sensors and AI algorithms, providing dual assurance and successfully overcoming the technical challenges of non-contact elevator buttons in the market. Our solution seamlessly integrates into daily life, allowing users to enjoy stable and precise elevator operations without needing to change their operating habits. Compared to traditional disinfection methods, our technology not only effectively prevents virus transmission but also significantly reduces resource waste and enhances public health standards. This AI-powered non-contact add-on device is suitable for all types of new and old elevators, with no need to replace the existing panels, and can be installed in under three hours, greatly reducing renovation time and costs. Even elevators with access control systems operate smoothly and are unaffected by the device.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, m'AI Touch will continue to uphold the spirit of innovation, developing more forward-looking technologies to create more value for smart living and provide more solutions to the global market.</p>
