                <p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) held the '2024 Outstanding Epidemic Prevention Award Ceremony' at the Sheraton Grand Taipei Hotel. With the theme 'Public-Private Collaboration for Epidemic Prevention and Public Safety,' the event recognized 68 individuals and organizations nationwide for their remarkable contributions to infectious disease prevention. The ceremony was attended by Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-Yuan and CDC Director-General Chuang Jen-Hsiang, who joined the awardees in completing a symbolic 'Epidemic Prevention Together' puzzle. This act underscored the indispensable nature of epidemic prevention efforts, requiring the collective strength of public and private sectors, interdisciplinary groups, and individuals to effectively combat outbreaks and safeguard public health.</p>
                <p>Among this year's honorees, Assistant Professor Chen Hung-Wen from the International Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program at National Tsing Hua University received the 2024 Outstanding Epidemic Prevention Individual Award in the Public Service Category from the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Professor Chen leveraged diverse professional expertise to lead the m'AI Touch team in developing the world's first 'contactless AI sensing technology' during the pandemic. This innovative solution reduces physical contact without altering existing user habits, successfully applied in public spaces such as hospitals and MRT station elevators. The technology significantly lowers the risk of disease transmission caused by surface contact, enhancing public health and safety.</p>
                <p>This cutting-edge technology integrates heterogeneous sensors and AI models, offering high versatility and sustainable benefits. It has been implemented in various physical settings and has received multiple accolades, including the National Startup Award, the National Science and Technology Council Future Tech Award, the Yunus Innovation Award, and the Delta Young Scholar Lecture Award. These achievements highlight the innovation in both technology and application, making a substantial contribution to epidemic prevention efforts and earning widespread recognition and praise.</p>
